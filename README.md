# Hello-World-Project-
Just started out using github 5-3-2018
And following the Hello-World guide as most do, but I used caps at the beginning of each title word, because one feels repetitive just following the guide, but not confident enough to ditch the guide all together.
As a brief introduction to myself, I started programming in C for a university class about 2 years ago, I excelled at the class but since my degree´s main focus wasn't programming I didn't follow up on it.
Forward 2 years and I started to get interested in programming again, this time, focused on deepening my understanding to advance my knowledge and giving me an edge in the search for an occupation, and empowering myself to be more demanding when it comes to the terms of my contract. 
In this quest of mine I first stumbled into JavaScript thanks to an occupational-hazard of mine, cryptocurrencies, and trying to learn it to help in the development of IOTA, a personal favorite. I joined Codewars to solve a never ending repository of small exercises, and can now solve Js Katas upto 6 Kyu.
Next, I heard about this amazing data-processing language Python, and saw it as an opportunity to consolidate both my degree and my interest in programming and technology, and it is at that stage that I find myself in. 
It is likely that I won´t update my description or that I will delete it some years down the road embarrassed by my arrogance and naivety so with that, 
print (“Hello World”);
